# Discord bot custom commands
This module gives every server the opportunity to create 5 custom commands.

# Usage

Create a file called `custom_commands.sqlite` in the main dicectory of your bot.
The code should start working if you paste it inside a folder in the main directory.

# HOWEVER
please don't just copy it :( you won't learn anything by pasting it, this module is public to help people who are trying it the same way as i did.

# disclaimer
edit: this was one of my first things to code that actually used some sort of data storage. not the best code.
